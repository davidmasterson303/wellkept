/**
 * Vehicle research — the model call and the write, with **no authorization**.
 *
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * ⚠ THIS FUNCTION AUTHORIZES NOTHING. EVERY CALLER MUST AUTHORIZE FIRST.
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * It spends money — a Pro-model call, up to three attempts — and writes to
 * `vehicle_knowledge_base` for whatever vehicle it is handed. There is no
 * session check, no ownership check and no rate limit inside it. Those belong
 * to the caller, and the two legitimate callers authorize in two different ways
 * because they are two different kinds of request:
 *
 *   - `generateVehicleDossier` in `app/actions.ts` — a user is present, so it
 *     checks `authorizeVehicleAccess` and applies the per-vehicle AI rate limit
 *     before delegating here.
 *   - the nightly sweep, `app/api/internal/notify-sweep/route.ts` — **no user
 *     exists by construction.** It is authorized by `CRON_SECRET`, compared in
 *     constant time at the route boundary, and it bounds its own spend with a
 *     per-run generation cap.
 *
 * ── Why this lives here and not in `app/actions.ts` ─────────────────────────
 *
 * `app/actions.ts` carries `'use server'`, which makes **every export in it a
 * publicly invokable POST endpoint.** Exporting an unauthorized variant from
 * that file would therefore not be a refactor — it would publish "generate a
 * dossier for any vehicle, no credential required" to the internet, on the most
 * expensive path in the product, and nothing in the type system or the build
 * would say a word about it.
 *
 * So the split is not tidiness. It is the only shape in which the sweep can
 * reuse this code without the reuse creating an open door, and it is why
 * `vehicle-research-callers.test.ts` keeps the caller list closed.
 *
 * ── Why the sweep is allowed to own this work at all ────────────────────────
 *
 * `enrichVehicle`'s docblock records that research is deliberately *not*
 * fire-and-forget, because work started after a response on a serverless
 * platform "may be frozen along with it" — so the dashboard calls it as a real
 * request with a real lifecycle. **The sweep satisfies that rule rather than
 * bending it:** it is a real request, awaited by a scheduled function, with
 * somewhere for failure to live. A second legitimate owner, not an exception.
 *
 * ── What this deliberately does NOT do: powertrain options ──────────────────
 *
 * `generateVehicleDossier` used to end by kicking off `fetchPowertrainOptions`
 * and writing the result back. That stays in `app/actions.ts` and did **not**
 * move here, because `fetchPowertrainOptions` calls `requireSession()` — it is
 * session-gated on purpose, and the sweep has no session to offer it.
 *
 * The consequence, stated rather than discovered later: **a dossier generated
 * by the sweep has no engine/transmission/drivetrain option lists until someone
 * opens the car.** That is acceptable where a missing schedule is not. The
 * option lists populate a dropdown on a screen a person is looking at, and the
 * existing UI path already fetches them on demand; the maintenance schedule is
 * what a notification is computed from, and nobody is looking at anything when
 * that runs.
 */

/**
 * How long one research attempt may take before it is abandoned.
 *
 * Exported so `app/actions.ts` shares this definition rather than keeping a
 * second copy — the timeout and the retry policy that reads it have to agree,
 * and they cannot agree if they are declared in two files.
 */

/**
 * The budget when nobody is waiting — the nightly sweep.
 *
 * ── ⚠ Measured, after a 30s budget lost a car permanently ───────────────────
 *
 * The dossier call takes **23-30 seconds**. `RESEARCH_TIMEOUT_MS` is 30. That
 * is not a timeout, it is a coin flip, and both faces were observed on 22 Aug:
 * a successful run finished in ~30s, and a sweep run an hour later timed out
 * against the same model on the same kind of car.
 *
 * ⚠ **A timeout in the sweep is not recoverable the way an interactive one
 * is.** It writes `research_status = 'failed'`, and `vehiclesToGenerate`
 * filter 1 never offers a `failed` car again — correctly, because retrying a
 * genuine failure nightly is the runaway that module exists to prevent. The
 * user's escape hatch is the retry button, and the sweep's entire purpose is
 * cars whose owner is *not in the app to press it*. So one marginal timeout
 * removes a car from research permanently, silently, and on the population the
 * feature was built for.
 *
 * The interactive budget stays at 30s: its own docblock's reasoning holds —
 * three deadlines plus backoff is 96 seconds of somebody watching a spinner.
 * **That argument does not apply at 3am.** Nobody is watching, so the only
 * cost of waiting is the function's own execution time.
 *
 * ⚠ **This multiplies against `SWEEP_GENERATE_CAP`.** Ten cars at 60s is ten
 * minutes of a Netlify scheduled function that gets fifteen, before NHTSA
 * fetches. Raising either number without the other in mind is how the sweep
 * starts dying halfway through and reporting a partial night as a whole one.

      ── Do not pay twice for a dossier this vehicle already has ──────────────

      ⚠ Added 22 Aug, from a live run that cost the discovery. Research for a
      new Accord **succeeded** — full dossier written, 24 NHTSA recalls stored,
      `research_status = 'completed'` — while the browser was told it had
      failed, because the request outlived its response and `enrichVehicle`
      came back with no body at all. The screen showed the failure state and a
      retry button.

      Pressing it went straight from the authorization check to the prompt.
      Nothing between the two asked whether the work had already been done, so
      a retry on a *successful* dossier spent another Pro call — the most
      expensive one in the product, ~4,900 tokens, measured the same day. The
      only reason it did not happen is that nobody pressed the button.

      ⚠ **The retry button is not wrong and this does not disable it.** Only
      `completed` short-circuits. A `failed` or `pending` row still generates,
      which is exactly what that button is for: its purpose is a dossier that
      is missing, and a missing dossier is not what this guard sees.

      Deliberately no `force` option. There is no caller that wants one today,
      and a flag whose only user is a future maybe is a flag that gets passed
      `true` by the next person in a hurry. Re-research is a real need when it
