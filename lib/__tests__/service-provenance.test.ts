/**
 * A service-due figure has to say what it rests on.
 *
 * @jest-environment node
 *
 * This app has rendered a provenance claim it could not substantiate twice —
 * `ae45710`'s fabricated "AI Verified" records, and the unconditional "AI
 * Extracted" badge that survived that clean-up and shipped to the public demo
 * on hand-typed and seeded rows. `provenance-claims.test.ts` holds the line on
 * that page; this holds it on the milestone screen, and it does so by deriving
 * every claim from `evaluateSchedule`'s own `basedOnHistory` flag rather than
 * letting a badge be written next to the data.
 *
 * The rule worth protecting is the mixed case: a milestone is only as
 * well-founded as its weakest service.
