/**
 * Where a service notification lands.
 *
 * This screen is opened by a push the app sent unprompted, so nobody chose to
 * come here and nobody is primed to be sceptical of what it says. That is why
 * David's 7 Aug decision was **confirm, then assert, with provenance** — all
 * three — and why the provenance half is worth testing rather than eyeballing:
 * a wrong label is invisible, and structure confers authority the two inputs
 * have not earned.
 *
 * ── Why history is the thing under test ─────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `evaluateSchedule` accepted `lastServiceMileage` and `lastServiceDate` from
 * the day it was written and **nothing ever passed either**, so every
 * time-based service reported `unknown` and every mileage-based one counted
 * from the odometer. The wiring that closed that is a day old and is the least
 * proven code on the screen.
 *
 * ── The two requests, and why only one may fail the screen ──────────────────
 *
 * `/load-vehicle` is the screen. `/load-maintenance-data` improves what it can
 * say. Losing the second returns the screen to exactly the behaviour it shipped
 * with, so it is caught and swallowed — asserted below, because a `Promise.all`
 * here would let a maintenance blip blank a screen a notification just opened.
