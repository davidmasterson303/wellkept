/**
 * The AA floor, measured on rendered screens.
 *
 * `lib/__tests__/mobile-text-contrast.test.ts` reads colour literals out of the
 * StyleSheets. That caught nine sub-floor styles and was worth writing, but it
 * cannot see a colour returned by a function, cannot know what is behind the
 * text, and reads each declaration in isolation rather than as the platform
 * merges them.
 *
 * The most important gap is the first. `healthBandHex()` returns the health
 * score's colour, so **the largest, most prominent number on two screens has
 * never been contrast-checked by anything** — the scan sees a function call.
 * The score is also the one colour that changes with the data, which is exactly
 * the case a literal scan is blind to.
 *
 * Both suites stay. The scan covers every style in the app including screens
 * nothing mounts; this covers fewer styles far more truthfully.
 *
 * ── Await every interaction ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * This file carried a "do not add a test below this line" warning from 8 to 15
 * August 2026, because everything after the add-a-car case rendered a null tree
 * and audited nothing — in green, since `belowFloor(...) === []` passes on an
 * empty audit. The cause was three un-awaited `fireEvent.changeText` calls:
 * **`render`, `fireEvent` and `userEvent` are all async in RNTL 14**, and
 * overlapping act scopes leave React unable to commit any later render for the
 * rest of the file. `jest.setup.js` carries the mechanism and now fails the
 * test that leaks the scope, and `belowFloor` refuses an empty audit.
 *
 * Use `userEvent` for every interaction, and await it. `fireEvent` works when
 * awaited but nothing in this app needs it.
