 * The one irreversible thing this app can do.

 * inside the app, and `mobile-account-reachable.test.ts` holds the *reachable*
 * half. This holds the half that matters more once someone arrives: that the
 * confirmation gate actually gates, and that the failure paths do not leave
 * someone believing their account is gone when it is not — or worse, still
 * signed in when it is.
 *
 * It had no behaviour coverage at all. Every rule below was enforced only by
 * reading the component.
 *
 * ── Why the confirm phrase is imported, not typed ───────────────────────────
 *
 * `DELETION_CONFIRM_PHRASE` comes from `@tappet/core/account-deletion`, the
 * same module the screen uses. Writing `'DELETE'` as a literal here would let
 * the phrase change in core and leave this suite green against a screen asking
 * for something else — a test that passes while the product it describes has
 * moved. The same reason `contrast.test.tsx` imports its floor.

  /*
    ── ⚠ Read this before mutation-testing this block ────────────────────────

    The gate is **two layers**, and that is deliberate:

      1. `disabled={!confirmed || deleting}` on the Pressable — the press never
         reaches the handler.
      2. `if (!confirmed || deleting) return;` at the top of `handleDelete` —
         the handler refuses regardless of how it was called.

    So removing *either one alone leaves this block green*, because the other
    still holds. Measured, not assumed: dropping the handler guard passes 10/10,
    dropping the `disabled` prop passes 10/10, dropping **both** fails two.

    That is defence in depth working, not a weak test. The property being
    asserted is "an unconfirmed account is not deleted", and that property is
    the conjunction — it survives either layer being removed, which is the
    entire point of having two on an irreversible action.

    ── The limit, stated rather than papered over ────────────────────────────

    **Neither layer can be pinned individually from a render test**, and an
    attempt to do it produced two tests that could not fail:

      - Reaching the handler past the `disabled` prop needs `onPress`, and
        `getByLabelText` returns the host `View`, whose `onPress` is
        `undefined`. `button.props.onPress?.()` is a silent no-op — the same
        trap `AddVehicleScreen.test.tsx` documents for `fireEvent`, in a new
        costume.
      - Asserting `accessibilityState.disabled` does not test the `disabled`
        prop either: that state is written explicitly and stays correct when
        the prop is removed.

    Both were deleted rather than left in wearing names they did not earn. A
    single-layer regression is therefore **not** caught here — it is caught by
    the next one, which is what the second layer is for. If that is ever not
    good enough, the instrument is a unit test of `handleDelete` extracted from
    the component, not a cleverer query.
