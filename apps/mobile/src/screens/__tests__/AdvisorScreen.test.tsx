/**
 * The advisor's answer, rendered.
 *
 * ── The defect this covers shipped and was found by eye ─────────────────────
 *
 * A real reply displayed literal `**$1,461**` and `* **Front Brakes &
 * Rotors:**` on screen. The web had a bold renderer; the phone had none, so
 * the flagship screen of a portfolio app showed its own markup.
 *
 * `lib/__tests__/answer-markup.test.ts` covers the tokeniser and is worth
 * keeping — it holds the parsing rules, including that a lone asterisk in
 * "25 ft-lb * 2" is arithmetic and must survive. But a correct tokeniser
 * wired to nothing renders exactly the same asterisks. **Only mounting the
 * screen tests the thing the user sees**, and nothing did until now.
