/**
 * Phase 3.4 — ask the advisor about one car.
 *
 * The third of the three flows `cc-product-0001` says mobile is, and the one
 * carrying the App Store 4.2 Minimum Functionality argument: a garage list and
 * a detail screen are a database viewer, and this is the part that is not.
 *
 * ── Why this needed no new native dependency, and 3.3 will ──────────────────
 *
 * Text in, text out, over the `/api/v1/consultant` route that Phase 3.0 built.
 * So it costs **zero EAS builds** — the dev client already on the simulator
 * loads it from Metro like any other JS change. Invoice scan (3.3) will not be
 * free in the same way: a camera or an image picker is a native module, and
 * adding one spends a second build out of fifteen a month. That is the reason
 * this was built first and it is a scheduling fact, not a preference.
 *
 * ── The thread id is the whole state model ──────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The server owns the conversation. It reads `message_history` from the
 * database, ignores any history a caller posts, and returns the thread's id on
 * every answer. So this screen keeps exactly one piece of durable state —
 * `sessionId` — and the messages it draws are a **local echo for the eye**, not
 * the record. Reopening the screen starts a new thread; it does not resume the
 * old one, and it does not pretend to.
 *
 * ⚠ **The reason given here for that was wrong, and was wrong when written.**
 * It said resuming "is `GET`-shaped work no route exposes to a bearer token
 * yet", so a picker would mean querying Supabase from the device. But
 * `GET /api/v1/consultant/conversations` authorizes through
 * `authorizeVehicleAccess` — the same bearer-capable path every other call here
 * uses — and it shipped in **this screen's own commit**, `28ee713`.
 *
 * So no route needed building and nothing would have to touch Supabase
 * directly. What is actually missing is a conversation list in the UI and a
 * decision about whether reopening resumes the last thread or offers a choice.
 * That is a product call for Phase 5.5, not a technical blocker — recorded
 * accurately on 12 Aug 2026 after the original reason was checked and did not
 * hold.
 *
 * `sessionId` lives in a ref rather than state on purpose. It is read inside an
 * async send and never rendered, so putting it in state would schedule a render
 * for a value nothing draws, and — worse — a second message sent before that
 * render committed would read a stale id and fork the thread.
 *
 * ── Failure is four different things and they are not one alert ─────────────
 *
 * **401** — the session died. `App.tsx` swaps to sign-in as soon as it clears,
 * so this calls `onSignOut` and says so plainly rather than offering a retry
 * that cannot work.
 * **429** — the vehicle's AI allowance, keyed by vehicle in `checkRateLimit`.
 * It is temporary and the honest word is "busy", not "failed".
 * **502** — Gemini declined or timed out. The question is intact and retrying
 * is reasonable, so the text stays in the composer.
 * **0** — no connectivity, which `apiRequest` distinguishes deliberately.
 *
 * In every case the typed question is **left in the box**. Losing what someone
 * wrote is worse than any error message, and a failed send that clears the
 * composer is how a retry becomes a retype.
