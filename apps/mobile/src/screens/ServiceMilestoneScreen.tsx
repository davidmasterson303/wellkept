/**
 * Phase 5.6 — where a service-due notification lands.
 *
 * ── Confirm, then assert, with provenance. All three ────────────────────────
 *
 * David's decision, 7 Aug. The schedule comes from a model and the odometer is
 * user-reported, so the screen opens on **the mileage it is about to reason
 * from** rather than asserting a milestone over an unverified number. Confirm
 * or correct, then the answer.
 *
 * That ordering is not politeness. Every figure below is derived from the
 * reading, so a stale odometer does not make the screen slightly wrong — it
 * makes it confidently wrong, which is the failure mode a notification cannot
 * afford.
 *
 * ── Why the provenance label is not decoration ──────────────────────────────
 *
 * This app has shipped unsubstantiated provenance claims twice, and
 * `provenance-claims.test.ts` exists because of it. Every label here derives
 * from `evaluateSchedule`'s own `evidence` field, and each row carries the
 * claim its own evidence supports — because a reader takes "from your service
 * records" as covering whatever it sits beside.
 *
 * Three rungs since Track A2a, not two: records, then what the owner told us at
 * sign-up, then a bare estimate. The middle one exists because an invoice is a
 * document and a recollection is not, and collapsing them would make the app
 * cite a memory as a record. The label is rendered by lookup, so a fourth rung
 * would appear here without an edit — `isServiceBasis` is what stops an
 * unrecognised one drawing a blank chip.
 *
 * ── ⚠ 12 Sep · per row, not per milestone ───────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The milestone used to carry one line — `milestoneBasis`, the *weakest* claim
 * its services could jointly support — so a visit mixing an invoice with an
 * estimate said "estimated" over both. Conservative, and true, but it threw
 * away a distinction the data holds. Web's due list (`ServiceDueList.tsx`)
 * answers per row, and `service-provenance.ts` argues at length why the three
 * sources must never share a sentence; the phone joins that: every row that
 * has a position says where the position came from, in its own line.
 *
 * ── What is deliberately not here ───────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Nothing books an appointment. Needs — the Plan tab's list — is the action:
 * it is what the advisor prices, and adding a job to it is the step that
 * actually leads somewhere in this product.
 *
 * ── ⚠ 12 Sep · the list is the spec table, and the whole schedule is on it ──
 *
 * Locked brief B6: *"Factors, recommendations and every record list are a mono
 * spec table with 01 indices, right-aligned numerals, hairline rows."* This
 * segment was the one list on the phone that was not: bold sans heads, prose
 * rows, and a full-width "Add to wishlist" slab under each of them, inside a
 * bordered card. The critique's words (round 30): *"the tab speaks two
 * dialects and the weaker one is the landing segment."*
 *
 * It is the History table now — the same row the record list draws, with the
 * position where the price goes — and it lists **every** service the schedule
 * evaluates, not only the next visit. The screen used to show the milestone
 * and nothing else, so a car with a schedule and nothing due read "Nothing due
 * right now" over a blank, and the six services coming up were invisible.
 * Web's Due lists them all in urgency order (`ServiceDueList.tsx`, 8 Sep:
 * *"Due computes what is due, instead of listing the schedule"*), and the
 * phone joins that. The milestone is still the unit — it heads the table and
 * carries the notification's own sentence — and what is not part of the visit
 * sits under its own head beneath it, so the grouping `service-due.ts` argues
 * for is visible rather than implied by omission.

    due was on the other side of answering it. The review's general rule came
    out of this exact screen — **no screen exists whose only content is one
    question.** It is a sheet, a banner, or an inline edit.

    So the schedule renders either way and the question sits above it. Two taps

 * One service, as a row of the spec table.

 * sans the record's provenance line uses, the rule the position was computed
 * from and where the count started (`service-provenance.ts`).
 *
 * ── The action is a word in the row, not a slab under it ────────────────────
 *
 * "Add to wishlist" was a full-width graphite button under every row — the
 * critique's *"list-item-with-CTA templating"*, three of them outweighing the
 * three lines they served. It is a mono caps word now, the voice the roots
 * give their chrome (ADD CAR, ADD, ACCOUNT). Once added it becomes its state
 * — ADDED, in the state ink, no longer pressable — because the outcome the
 * control wanted is the thing to show, not a disabled verb.
 *
 * ⚠ 12 Sep · **on the meta line, so the numeral reaches the rule.** Round 31
 * put the word in a column of its own beside the position, and the critique
 * measured what that cost: every numeral stopped inboard of the rule by the
 * column's width, and the longest name wrapped to an orphaned "inspect". A
 * spec table's numerals end at the rule (B6; the History rows do), so the
 * head line is index, name, mark, position — the record row exactly — and
 * the action sits at the end of the second line, beside the rule it was
 * computed from. Its 44pt target is centred on that 16pt line and reaches
 * into the head line above it; the row does not grow around it.
 *
 * ⚠ The row itself is deliberately **not** the affordance, which is what the
 * critique proposed instead. A tap that writes a row to Needs, with no
 * visible verb, is a write on a mis-scroll; `WishlistAddScreen` made the same
 * call for its own rows (R39: *"the card itself is deliberately not the
 * affordance"*), and the History row's tap *opens* something rather than
 * writing. The verb stays visible; it moves off the numeral's line.
 *
 * ⚠ The name is in the accessible label: "ADD" alone is unambiguous to an eye
 * that can see the row it sits in, and ambiguous to a reader that hears
 * eight of them.
