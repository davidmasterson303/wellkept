 * Account — sign out, and delete the account. App Store guideline 5.1.1(v).
 *
 * ── Why this screen exists ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Apple requires account deletion to be initiated from inside the reviewed app
 * and routinely rejects "delete your account on our website". Deletion has
 * worked since Phase 1 and the bearer-capable route has existed since 1 Aug —
 * what was missing was any way to reach it from the phone. `apps/mobile/src`
 * held exactly two screens and no account surface at all, which is why the
 * roadmap carries 5.1.1(v) as 🔴 absent rather than as untested.
 *
 * ── Reachable, and not buried ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The guideline says the option must be genuinely available. It is one tap
 * from the garage — the only screen a signed-in user sees — and not behind a
 * web view, an email request or a support form.
 *
 * ── The confirmation is the same one the web asks for ───────────────────────
 *
 * Type-to-confirm, with the phrase and the comparison imported rather than
 * rewritten. Apple permits a confirmation step provided it is not
 * "unnecessarily difficult"; one word is enough to stop a misclick on an
 * irreversible action and not enough to obstruct someone who means it.
 *
 * The inventory is spelled out rather than summarised as "your data", because
 * "your data" is the phrasing that lets someone agree to this without
 * realising it takes the invoice images too.

 *
 * `scripts/verify-mobile-contract.mjs` needs `MOBILE_TEST_TOKEN`, and without
 * it the bearer happy path, the unowned-vehicle 404 and the garage-list
 * assertions all `skip()`. They skipped across five pieces of work because
 * there was no way to get the value off the phone. Deleting this would reopen
 * that gap, so it travels — it just stops travelling on the home screen.
 *
 * ── Why it is here and not on `GarageScreen` ────────────────────────────────
 *
 * It shipped at the foot of the garage, which is the first screen every user
 * sees and the first screenshot anybody takes of this app. `__DEV__` meant no
 * release build ever rendered it, so nothing was leaked — but a dev-only block
 * on the home screen is still a decision *about the home screen*, and it was
 * the last thing on the product's front page in every capture taken for review.
 *
 * Account is one tap from the garage and is already where the app keeps the
 * things about the account rather than about the car. Same reachability, off
 * the front page.
 *
 * ⚠ `__DEV__` is not decoration. A bearer token is a password for the API until
 * it expires, and a shipping build must not render one where a screenshot or a
 * shoulder can take it. Expo Go is always `__DEV__`; a release build compiles
 * the branch out, which `lib/__tests__/mobile-dev-session-stripped.test.ts`
 * holds this app to.
