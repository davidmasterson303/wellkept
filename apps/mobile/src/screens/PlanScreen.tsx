/**
 * Plan: what this car needs, and what you want to do to it.
 *
 * ── ⚠ R15 · one question, split across two hub rows ─────────────────────────
 *
 * `Wishlist` and `Build` both answer *"what should I do to this car next"*.
 * Both are ordered lists of jobs with chips, both have a suggestions source and
 * a user-added path, and the only difference is that one is **needs** and the
 * other is **wants**.
 *
 * Splitting them across two destinations made the owner classify a job before
 * they could look for it — and the review's example is exact: a **charge pipe**
 * on an M235i is genuinely both. It is a known failure point and it is the
 * first thing anyone modifies. Under two lists it is filed wrong half the time
 * and then cannot be found.
 *
 * ── What stays on which side ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The **progression ladder stays on `Mods`**, because it is specific to mods:
 * "control before more power" is advice about modifying, not about maintenance.
 * The build dial goes with it and reports that segment.
 *
 * ⚠ `Mods` is shown only when the owner has not answered "stock" — the same
 * `showsModifications` gate the hub row had. A person who told us they are not
 * modifying the car should not be offered a segment about modifying it, and a
 * one-segment control is not a control.

    control per state". That `+` was the old stack header's, and the 11 Sep
    tab rebuild replaced the header with `RootScreen`'s band. Nothing put the
    control back: David, on his phone the same night, "i'm missing options to
    add more items to my list". It is the Garage's "Add car" exactly — a mono
    caps word at the band's trailing edge, `RootScreen`'s `trailing`, in the
