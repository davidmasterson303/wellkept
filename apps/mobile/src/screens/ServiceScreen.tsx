 * Service: what is due, and what has been done.

 * ── ⚠ R14 · two hub rows were one question ──────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `Service due` and `Service history` were siblings on the vehicle hub, and the
 * v8.3 review's finding was that neither survives the question "which of these
 * do I open". They are the same subject seen from two ends: what this car has
 * had done, and what it needs next — and the second is computed **from** the
 * first, so a person comparing them was navigating between two screens to hold
 * one thought.
 *
 * `Service due` was also the review's example of a screen that should not
 * exist: one question, one field, one button, and 70% of the display empty
 * under it. §5's general rule came out of it — *no screen exists whose only
 * content is one question.*
 *
 * ── Why a container rather than a rewrite ───────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Both halves keep their own component, their own fetch and their own tests.
 * The merge is a **navigation** change — one destination instead of two — and
 * rewriting two working screens to make one route out of them would have
 * spent the risk on the part that was not broken.
 *
 * ⚠ The inactive segment is **unmounted**, not hidden. Each half loads on
 * mount, and keeping both alive would fire two requests for a screen the owner
 * has only asked one question of. Switching back re-fetches, which is also
 * the honest behaviour after marking something done on the other side.

    rendered by the navigator — so they arrive as callbacks for the same reason
    every other route transition in this tree does. A screen that imported

    `useState` reads its argument once. `Service` is now reachable two ways —
    the car's hub, which lands on Due, and the History tab, which asks for
    history — and `navigate` on an already-mounted screen updates params
    **without remounting**. So tapping History while looking at Due did
    nothing at all: the params said history, the state still said due.

    ⚠ Residual, stated rather than hidden: if somebody arrives on history,
    switches to Due by hand and taps History again, the param has not changed,
    so this does not fire and the screen stays on Due. Fixing that needs the
    bar to force a params update, and it is a much rarer path than the one
    above. Worth doing if it is ever reported; not worth a nonce param today.

        the invoice would fix that"* with nothing beside it to scan with.

        property of "due" or of "history"; it is what this screen is *for*, and a
