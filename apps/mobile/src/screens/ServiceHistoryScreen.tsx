/**
 * What has been done to this car, on the phone.
 *
 * ── Why this exists ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The phone could **write** to the service record in three ways — scan an
 * invoice, complete a wishlist item, answer the onboarding history question —
 * and could not read it back anywhere. The only surface that showed any of it
 * was `ServiceMilestoneScreen`, which you reach by tapping a service-due
 * notification, and no notification has ever fired.
 *
 * So a person could file a job from the shop's car park and have no way to
 * confirm it landed. That is the loop this closes.
 *
 * ── Provenance is the point, not decoration ────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Four rows in one column, identical in weight, read as four equally solid
 * facts. One of them may be a recollection typed on a sign-up screen. The
 * schema went to the trouble of storing that difference —
 * `20260808150000` added `'owner-onboarding'` rather than reusing `'manual'`
 * specifically so it could be said — and a list is where it becomes visible or
 * is lost.
 *
 * ── The total is the number most likely to be misread ──────────────────────
 *
 * Rows without a cost are skipped rather than counted as zero, and the header
 * says how many rows the figure covers. "$1,820 across 6 of 9 services" is a
 * different claim from "$1,820", and only one of them is true.

  Every value on this screen was a proportional sans — prices, dates, totals,
  the record count — so a column of amounts did not line up as a column and the
  eye had to read each one rather than scan them. `TABULAR` was already applied
  and could not help: tabular *figures* keep a font's digits the same width as
  each other; they do not make Inter behave like a mono in a table.

  Vendors take the condensed grotesk, as section heads. Amounts, dates and
  counts take the mono. The `01` index is the one clause not carried here — the
  rows are grouped by vendor rather than enumerated, so an index would number
  line items inside a visit and not the visits themselves, which is the opposite

    added the index is the change that broke it.
