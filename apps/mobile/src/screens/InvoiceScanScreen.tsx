/**
 * Phase 3.3 — photograph an invoice and have its line items read.
 *
 * ── Why the library image is injected rather than imported ──────────────────
 *
 * This file never imports `expo-image-picker`. The library image arrives
 * through a `pickImage` prop, exactly as `GarageScreen` takes `onOpenVehicle`
 * rather than importing react-navigation.
 *
 * That began as a scheduling constraint and is now a design one. The dev client
 * was built before the picker was a dependency, so importing it anywhere in the
 * module graph would have crashed the app on launch — the screen was therefore
 * written, routed and rendered *before* build `29b4d76f` existed, and wiring the
 * real picker afterwards touched one file. The reason to keep the seam is what
 * it bought: this screen is an ordinary component that can be rendered with a
 * stub, which is the only reason it was ever looked at before the camera
 * existed.
 *
 * ── ⚠ 12 Sep · the camera is the screen now — brief B9 ─────────────────────
 *
 * The idle frame *is* the viewfinder (`components/Viewfinder.tsx`): the live
 * feed under the header, hairline brackets, a mono readout, a capture control,
 * and CHOOSE FROM LIBRARY beside it. The camera path no longer goes through
 * `pickImage` — the viewfinder captures with `expo-camera` and hands `send`
 * the same `InvoiceFile` the picker would have, at the same quality
 * (`media/invoice-image.ts`) — so the prop's source is the library alone. The
 * seam stays for that path, and for the reason above: the screen still mounts
 * with a stub. What changed is that `Viewfinder` imports its native modules
 * directly; its docblock says why that is safe on every runtime this app has
 * left, and which one it is not.
 *
 * ── The outcomes, and why two of them are not errors ────────────────────────
 *
 * `uploadInvoice` returns a discriminated result rather than throwing for the
 * two answers the server actually reached:
 *
 *   - **vehicle-mismatch** — the invoice reads as a different car. The owner is
 *     the one who knows, so this offers to send it again with the heuristic
 *     overridden. It is a question, not a failure, and it is phrased as one.
 *   - **not-an-invoice** — the photograph is not an automotive invoice.
 *
 * Both arrive as HTTP 200. A screen written against exceptions alone would show
 * "uploaded" for both, which is the defect `documents.ts` is shaped to prevent
 * and the reason that shape is worth the extra type.
 *
 * ── What is kept when something goes wrong ──────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The chosen file. Every failure path leaves `file` set, so "Try again" resends
 * what was already picked rather than reopening the camera — the same rule as
 * the advisor's composer, where losing what someone produced is worse than any
 * error message. Re-photographing a bill you are standing next to is a small
 * cost; re-photographing one you have already thrown away is not.

  ── 12 Sep · the wait carries its phase, not a sentence ─────────────────────

  `working` held a `note` — "Opening the camera…", "Reading the invoice…",
  "Filing it against this car…" — three boundaries this screen genuinely
  observes, written as three loose strings. They are a `ScanPhase` now, so the
  wait instrument can draw them as a ledger (`working-stages.ts` says which
  phases exist and why the third is only sometimes drawn) and the line and the
  ledger come from one mapping rather than two spellings.

  ⚠ `'camera'` never reaches the wait at `picking` any more: the viewfinder
  is the picking, on its own frame with its own readout (CAPTURING), and the
  wait begins once the file exists. The source still travels so the ledger's
  first row is named for what happened — "Photographing the invoice", done.
