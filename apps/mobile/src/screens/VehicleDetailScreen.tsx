/**
 * Phase 3.2, second half — the detail behind a garage row.
 *
 * The list has existed since 1 Aug and its rows were not tappable, so this is
 * the half of 3.2 that was never built rather than a new idea.
 *
 * ── One request, and no photograph ──────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `GET /api/v1/load-vehicle?vehicleId=…` returns the vehicle, its knowledge
 * base, the computed health drivers and the score history in one round trip —
 * already stripped of `custom_image_url` and carrying a signed `photo_url`.
 *
 * ── The photograph, which this screen used to decline to draw ───────────────
 *
 * It did, and the reason was sound at the time: the signed URL points at the
 * stored original, the one real photo on this account is a 2.3 MB legacy upload
 * that never decodes on a device, and repeating the garage card's timeout
 * machinery here would have doubled a net rather than removed the need for one.
 *
 * All three parts of that changed on 15 Aug. The net is now **one component** —
 * `VehiclePlate` owns the timeout, the two exits from loading and the fallback,
 * so the hero reuses it rather than copying it. And the plate is no longer a
 * dead end: `/api/v1/upload-photo` means a car that falls back to it can be
 * given a picture from this screen.
 * `GarageScreen`'s `PHOTO_TIMEOUT_MS` docblock carries the full measurement.
 *
 * ── States, and which ones are not errors ───────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Loading, loaded, and the two that get skipped. **401** is not an error box:
 * `App.tsx` swaps to sign-in the moment the session clears, so this reports it
 * plainly and calls `onSignOut`. **404** is its own state and not a crash — a
 * vehicle deleted on the web while this screen sat open is an ordinary race,
 * and the honest answer is that it is gone, with a way back.
 *
 * ── Why the shared health band, again ───────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Same reasoning as the garage: `@tappet/core/health-band` holds the
 * thresholds and the wording, the web dashboard reads it, and a local copy of
 * "80 is good" drifts silently. This screen and the row it came from must
 * agree, and the only way to guarantee that is to not have a second opinion.

   * The photo control's one tap.
   *
   * ── ⚠ Why a sheet, not a second control ───────────────────────────────────
   *
   * The nav row over the photograph holds one control, and that is a decision
   * with a history: the score chip was cut from this exact slot because chrome
   * over the car crowds the title, and every round of the critique has read
   * the row as *one* control beside "‹ GARAGE". A standing REMOVE beside it
   * would put a second photo verb on the hero of a screen that is about the
   * car — and if it took the system's destructive treatment it would spend
   * sodium, which B7 reserves for genuine warnings, on a control that is
   * present every time the car has a picture.
   *
   * So the control keeps its name and its place, and iOS does what iOS does
   * for one control with two actions: an action sheet. It is also the web's
   * own structure — its "Change Vehicle Photo" dialog holds Remove *inside*
   * it — so the two clients agree on where Remove lives. The sheet and the
   * confirm are UIKit's surfaces, like every `Alert.alert` in this app; the
   * brief has nothing to grade there and the system spends no hue.
   *
   * ⚠ `ActionSheetIOS` is iOS-only and fails loudly where it is absent
   * (`invariant` in RN). This is the iOS app — every EAS profile is iOS — and
   * a silent `Alert` fallback for a platform nothing builds would be a branch
   * nothing exercises.
   *
   * With no photograph there is one action, so there is no sheet: "Add photo"
   * goes straight to the picker, as it always has.

        and the disagreement is written down for Design rather than settled
        unilaterally. See `docs/design-system-drift.md`.

        The body names the **worst open recall** instead of saying "what it
        means, and what to do about it". The spec's own line is *"One is a fuel

        Each row carries what is behind it where the screen knows: 18 services,

        `Service` is what this car has had done and what it needs; `Plan` is
        what to do to it next, needs and mods. Both open on the segment their
        row named, so nothing that used to be one tap away is now two.

        The counts move with them. `Service` shows the history count because
        that is the countable fact; `Plan` shows the needs count and total,
        which is the number an owner is actually tracking.

        ── ⚠ 12 Sep · B1 and B5: the hub is a spec table, not a settings list ─

        These were `NavRow`s in a `ListGroup`: a Lucide glyph, a sans
        title-case label, a sans count, an inset seam — the iOS grouped table.
        That form was David's own correction on 23 Aug (*"ugly and uninviting
        to engage with"*), made against a hub of four bare sans words in a
        card, and the glyphs were its answer. The locked brief came after it,
        and the first frame of this screen scrolled past the recall showed the
        cost: the one iOS-settings block in an app that is otherwise the spec
        table, with values ("No schedule yet", "5", "Daily Driver") in sans
        where the garage and the strip set the same strings in mono — and the
        clock and wrench meaning Plan and Service in the tab bar while meaning
        Service and History here.

        So the rows are `BandRow`s under a condensed eyebrow: full-width
        hairlines, condensed caps label, mono value at the right, every
        chevron on the right edge, no glyph — the web dossier's own
        destination rows (VEHICLE DOSSIER, WISHLIST). What David asked for
        survives as structure: the label sits outside the group, the rows are
        56pt and countable, and each carries what is behind it. Logged in
        `docs/design-system-drift.md` §6.13 as a supersession of the 23 Aug
        decision, for him to overrule.

        Each row carries what is behind it where the screen knows: a count, a
        total, a timing. Where it does not know, it carries **nothing** —

        23 Aug: *"we can lose the dial with health score overlaying car image.
        The animation is fun but info is redundant and it might cover an
        important part of the car image people care about."*

        Both halves are right, and the second is the one that settles it. The
        photograph is the only place in the product an owner sees their own car,
        and a 160pt plinth sat in the middle of it — over the roofline on most
        3:4 phone snapshots. An instrument that obscures the subject it is
        reporting on has its priorities inverted.

        The redundancy was real too, and self-inflicted: the health card gained
        its own reading earlier the same day, so by then the score appeared
        three times. Two remain, and they do different jobs — this is chrome
        that persists, and the card's is the subject of the paragraph under it.

        What went with it: `dialFlight`, the 1.6× climb, the crossfade, and the
        layering invariant that was the hardest part of the design. There is no
        travelling instrument left to collide with the sheet, so the rule that
        governed it has nothing to govern. That is a real simplification rather
