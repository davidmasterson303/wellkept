/**
 * The signed-in navigation. Phase 3 task 3.5, pulled forward; rebuilt 11 Sep.
 *
 * ── Why this exists before the screens that need it ─────────────────────────
 *
 * The plan sizes navigation at 0.5 ed and puts it last, which reads as polish.
 * It is not: the garage rows were not tappable and there was nowhere to tap
 * *to*, so 3.2 has been half-built — a list with no detail — and 3.3 and 3.4
 * are a camera flow and a conversation thread, both of which need push and
 * back. Ad-hoc booleans were fine for one modal and are not a stack.
 *
 * The timing is the other half. `react-native-screens` and
 * `react-native-safe-area-context` are **native** modules, so they have to be
 * present when the app is compiled. Adding navigation after the first EAS
 * build would cost a second build out of a monthly allowance of fifteen.
 *
 * ── ⚠ 11 Sep · B8: four tab roots, each with its own stack ──────────────────
 *
 * Locked brief B8: *"Tab roots carry no back chevron"*, and the studio
 * paragraph: *"Four tab roots, none with a back chevron; the dossier stack
 * (Garage → Vehicle → Health/Service/Plan) lives in the first tab."*
 *
 * Until today this was **one** native stack with a hand-drawn bar over it, and
 * every tab press `reset` the whole stack — drift §6.6 recorded it as the one
 * checklist line that was a navigation rebuild rather than a styling change.
 * The tree is now:
 *
 *     NavigationContainer
 *     └─ Stack (root)            Tabs · Account
 *        └─ Tabs                 GarageTab · ServiceTab · PlanTab · AdvisorTab
 *           ├─ Stack (garage)    Garage → VehicleDetail → Health / Service / Plan / …
 *           ├─ Stack (service)   Service → InvoiceScan / InvoiceDetail
 *           ├─ Stack (plan)      Plan → WishlistAdd / Advisor
 *           └─ Stack (advisor)   Advisor
 *
 * Each tab owns its history — leave the car for Service and come back, and you
 * are still on the car — and a root cannot grow a chevron, because there is
 * nothing beneath it to point at. `backBehavior="none"` on the tabs is what
 * keeps that literal: with the default, `canGoBack()` on any tab but the first
 * answers *yes* (back would mean "first tab"), and `rootTitle` would put a
 * header on three roots pointing sideways at the garage.
 *
 * ⚠ **One `Stack` factory serves every native stack.** The five navigators
 * share `RootStackParamList`, so a screen can name any destination and React
 * Navigation resolves it upward — `Service` pushes in the dossier when the hub
 * asks and lives at its own root when the tab does. The cost is that the type
 * does not say which stack registers which screen; the linking config below
 * and `mobile-back-labels.test.ts` do.
 *
 * ── ⚠ The account is pushed *over* the tabs, and its way in is outside them ─
 *
 * `Account` is a route on the root stack: it covers the tab bar, carries a
 * native header whose back label names the tab it was opened from, and is
 * reached from `AccountControl` — still a sibling of the navigator, still
 * outside every screen, because App Store 5.1.1(v) and
 * `mobile-account-reachable.test.ts` both depend on no screen's early return
 * being able to take it away. See that file's docblock for the history.
 *
 * ── Why the screens do not import this file ─────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `GarageScreen` takes an `onOpenVehicle` callback rather than a `navigation`
 * prop, and `VehicleDetailScreen` takes `vehicleId` and `onBack`. So neither
 * knows react-navigation exists: they stay ordinary components that can be
 * rendered and reasoned about on their own, and swapping the navigator later
 * touches this file only. Today was that swap, and it touched this file, the
 * bar and the tests that read them.
 *
 * ── The token is not a route param, and that is not an oversight ────────────
 *
 * `apiRequest` fetches the live session per call, so no screen needs a token
 * passed to it. Navigation params are serialisable state — they show up in
 * devtools and in any persisted navigation state — which makes them the wrong
 * place for a credential even when it would be convenient. Only `vehicleId`
 * and a title travel, and neither is a secret.
 */

/**
 * The screens the tab stacks register between them.
 *
 * ⚠ Kept free of `Tabs` on purpose. `TabParamList` nests this list and
 * `RootStackParamList` nests `TabParamList`; a `Tabs` entry here would close
 * that loop and TypeScript refuses a param list that references itself
 * through `NavigatorScreenParams`. The root's own list adds it below.

    Product, not scaffolding: the recall notification this app sends says "Tap

    just posed. A push that promises an answer should deliver the question.

 * ── Why this exists, stated honestly ────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The immediate reason is verification. This project's most expensive recurring

 * never been rendered** — the 4 Aug handoff records three of those in one day,
 * and both of these screens were written before anything could open them. A
 * stack you can only reach by tapping is a stack that only gets exercised when
 * someone is holding the phone.
 *
 * With this, `xcrun simctl openurl booted "tappet://vehicle/<id>/advisor"`
 * opens the screen directly, so it can be looked at in the state that matters
 * without a session, a garage row and two taps standing in front of it.
 *
 * It is also ordinary product functionality rather than test scaffolding, which
 * is the reason it is wired here rather than hacked in behind `__DEV__`: the
 * scheme is already declared in `app.json`, push notifications and emailed
 * links both land on exactly these routes, and the alternative — a temporary
 * `initialRouteName` edited in and out whenever something needs looking at —
 * is throwaway work that leaves nothing behind.
 *
 * ── ⚠ 11 Sep · the config is a tree, because the navigators are ─────────────
 *
 * A path now names a tab as well as a screen: `vehicle/:vehicleId/service`
 * opens the Service *tab* at its root, not a Service pushed onto the garage,
 * so a notification lands where the bar would have taken you. The dossier's
 * pushed screens — a car, its health, its recalls, the scan — stay under the
 * Garage tab, which is the stack the brief gives them.
 *
 * ── ⚠ MOB-07 · a cold-start notification tap trapped the user ───────────────
 *
 * Without an `initialRouteName`, a link opened from a **cold start** produces a
 * stack with **exactly one route**: no back button, the edge-swipe gesture does
 * nothing, `goBack()` is a no-op. The only way out was force-quitting the app.
 * That is the flagship path — a recall notification says *"Tap to see what it
 * means"*, and this product delivered its first real ones on 16 Aug.
 *
 * Two of them now, one per level, and each does one job:
 *
 *   - `initialRouteName: 'Tabs'` on the root stack, so `tappet://account` opens
 *     over the tabs rather than as the only screen in the app.
 *   - `initialRouteName: 'Garage'` on the **garage stack's** config, so a link
 *     to a car or its recalls seeds the garage underneath, and the back button
 *     and the gesture both land somewhere that makes sense.
 *
 * ⚠ The second one has to be inside `GarageTab`. At the root it would name a
 * route the root stack does not have, type-check anyway, and seed nothing —
 * `mobile-push-routing.test.ts` pins it to the object that registers
 * `vehicle/:vehicleId`. The tab roots need none: a tab's root has the bar
 * under it, which is a way out.
 *
 * ── What is deliberately not linkable ───────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The forms — `AddVehicle`, `WishlistAdd`, `VehicleProfile` — and the visit
 * behind a line, which cannot be opened cold. Each says why at its param.
 *
 * ── The dev client owns one path and it is not one of these ─────────────────
 *
 * `expo-dev-client` answers `tappet://expo-development-client/?url=…`, which
 * is how the simulator build is pointed at Metro. Nothing here claims that
 * path, and the two coexist because the prefix is shared but the host is not.
 *
 * ── A link cannot carry a title, and must not ───────────────────────────────
 *
 * `title` is a convenience the garage row supplies because it has already drawn
 * the car's name. A URL knows only the id, so every screen falls back rather
 * than rendering "undefined" in the header. Putting the name in the URL would
 * be worse than a fallback: it is the car's identity in a string anything can
 * log, and the server is going to send the real one back within the second.

  ── ⚠ 6 Sep · B1 and B8: the nav bar stopped being Apple's ──────────────────

  This was four lines that set colours and left every other decision to UIKit,
  which meant six of the app's seven screens opened on a **centred, system-sans
  title** — the single most repeated off-system element in the product, and the
  thing that made every screen after the garage read as a stock iOS app.

  B8: *"condensed large titles collapse to mono"*. B1: *"mono for every value,
  date, index, state and tab label"* — a nav title is the collapsed form of a
  screen's name, so it takes the mono the brief gives the collapsed state.

  ⚠ **`headerTitleAlign: 'left'` does nothing on iOS**, and this note used to
  claim the opposite. native-stack's own types say it: *"Not supported on iOS.
  It's always `center` on iOS and cannot be changed."* UIKit centres a nav
  title, so a pushed screen's mono title sits centred over a left-aligned
  screen — the seam the critique kept finding. The roots escape it by hiding
  the header and drawing their own title (`RootScreen`); a left-aligned title
  on a *pushed* screen would need a custom `headerLeft` carrying the title
  beside the back control, which is a bigger change than this option and is
  not made here. The option stays for the day the app has an Android build.

  ⚠ **The caps are in the `title` strings, not here.** `headerTitleStyle` is
  handed to a native `UILabel`, which honours `fontFamily`, `fontSize`,
  `fontWeight` and `color` and silently ignores `textTransform` — so writing the
  transform here would have produced sentence-case titles with no error and no
  symptom, which is the §6 shape exactly. Each `title` below is written in caps
  instead.
*/
/**
 * ── ⚠ 6 Sep · B8: a tab root's header, and why it is conditional ────────────
 *
 * B8 asks for *"a left-aligned 34pt condensed-grotesk caps title that collapses
 * on scroll into a mono caps nav title"* and for roots to carry no back chevron.
 *
 * **`headerShown` follows `canGoBack()`** because `Service` and `Plan` are each
 * a root (their tab opens on them) and a pushed screen (the car's hub pushes
 * them), so this cannot be a static choice. `canGoBack()` asks exactly the
 * right question: the pushed instance keeps its header and its back control,
 * the root instance gets the clean top edge the garage always had — and draws
 * its own title through `RootScreen`, which collapses it into the mono form.
 *
 * ⚠ **11 Sep: the header's title is no longer blanked.** It was, because the
 * screen drew the condensed name in its body and two names on one screen is a
 * regression the critique named. Now `ScreenTitle` and `RootScreen` draw
 * nothing when a header is present, so the pushed instance reads like every
 * other pushed screen — the mono nav title, in the header, with the back label
 * beside it — and the root instance owns its large title. One name each way.
 *

    ── ⚠ 6 Sep · B1: the back label speaks the same language as the title ─────

    `VehicleDetailScreen` draws its own back control — mono caps "‹ GARAGE" with
    a hairline chevron — while every native-stack push used the platform default:
    a heavy chevron and a sentence-case sans label. The critique found both in
    one stack and called it "two back affordances", which is what it was.

    `headerBackTitleStyle` put the label in the mono nav face, and the chevron
    stayed native, on the reasoning that a hairline chevron per screen was a
    bigger change than one line.

    It was the bigger change, and it was still the gap: with the first frame
    of a screen pushed *from* the car in front of it, the critique read a thin
    "‹ GARAGE" on Vehicle and a heavy system chevron with "BMW M235i" in mixed
    case on Health — the native label cannot be capitalised, because the
    `UILabel` it becomes ignores `textTransform`. `headerLeft` replaces the
    native button (native-stack hides its own when one is given) with the
    component the vehicle screen already draws, so both screens read one
    control from one file. `label` is the previous screen's `title`, exactly
    what the native button would have shown; `BackControl` sets it in
    `monoNav`, whose uppercase is honoured by a JS `Text`.

 * ⚠ **A screen with `headerShown: false` and no `title` publishes its route
 * name.** native-stack takes the back label from the previous screen's `title`
 * and falls back to `route.name` when there is none — so hiding a header does
 * not remove that screen from the header of the next one, it only removes the
 * value it would have used. `VehicleDetail` hid its header on 23 Aug for the
 * hero pullback, and six screens pushed from it have read `‹ VehicleDetail`
 * ever since: a class name, in the product's voice, on the most-travelled back
 * button in the app.
 *
 * So `title` is still set below. It draws nothing — the header is off — and
 * does exactly one job, which is this label.
 *
 * ── Why the year comes off ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The title is `[year, make, model].join(' ')`, and "2015 BMW M235i" is past
 * what iOS will render in a back button: it silently collapses to "Back", which
 * is correct but says nothing. Dropping the leading year leaves "BMW M235i",
 * which fits and still names the car.
 *
 * Only a leading four-digit year is removed, and nothing else is guessed at.
 * Taking the last word instead would give "Cherokee" for a Grand Cherokee — the
 * kind of cleverness that is invisible until it is wrong on somebody's car.
