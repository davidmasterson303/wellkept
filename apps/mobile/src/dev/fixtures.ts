/**
 * Canned API responses, so the product screens can be driven with no server.
 *
 * ── ⚠ Why this exists ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The design loop grades screenshots of real screens. Twice now that has been
 * called blocked — once when the simulator's disk filled, once when its auth
 * path to Supabase wedged — and both times the reasoning was the same and wrong:
 * *the screens need data, not a session.* Auth is only the gate in front of the
 * data.
 *
 * The suite has always known this. `GarageScreen.test.tsx` and its siblings
 * render these exact screens against a mocked `apiRequest` and assert what they
 * draw. The capability existed; it was reachable only from jest.
 *
 * ⚠ **The shapes are lifted from those tests, not invented.** That matters more
 * than it sounds: `GarageScreen.test.tsx` carries a note about a fixture whose
 * recalls were `{ id: 1 }` — a shape NHTSA could never return — which passed
 * while the chip counted the raw array and stopped passing when it counted what
 * the recall screen would actually draw. A fixture that lies produces a
 * screenshot that lies, and a design critique of a screenshot that lies is worse
 * than no critique.
 *
 * ── Gating ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Read only by `api/client.ts`, behind `__DEV__` **and**
 * `EXPO_PUBLIC_DESIGN_FIXTURES=1`. Never in a release bundle, and never when the
 * flag is off — a build that quietly serves fixtures instead of the API is the
 * worst failure this file could have, because every screen would look perfect.

/**
 * ── 12 Sep · a photograph added through the control, kept for the session ──
 *
 * Claude Design's most specific request was the vehicle detail with a *real
 * owner photograph* under the house grade — a frame nobody had shot, because
 * every captured round showed the plate. `EXPO_PUBLIC_DESIGN_PHOTO_URL` can
 * put a photograph on the car, but it bypasses the control, and the control
 * is what the product runs: the action sheet, the picker and its encode at
 * `VEHICLE_QUALITY`, the upload, the reload. The dev account's password is
 * stale (400) and the demo's cars refuse writes, so the real route cannot be
 * driven from a simulator at all.
 *
 * So the fixture answers the upload. `POST /upload-photo` is answered with
 * the picked file's own `uri` — read off React Native's `FormData` parts, the
 * shape `api/photos.ts` sends — and the car answers with that `uri` as its
 * `photo_url` from then on; `DELETE` takes it away again. Everything the
 * product does to the pixels still happens: the encode is the picker's, and
 * the server stores what it is sent byte for byte (`uploadVehiclePhoto` in
 * `app/actions.ts` — `Buffer.from(arrayBuffer)`, no resize, no re-encode), so
 * a frame shot this way is the frame the product would draw. The one thing it
 * cannot exercise is the network hop, and a capture that leans on this says
 * so.
 *
 * ⚠ Session-scoped on purpose — a reload of the bundle forgets it, the same
 * way it forgets everything else here. A fixture that persisted a
