/**
 * The fixture car takes a photograph through the control and keeps it for
 * the session.
 *
 * `dev/fixtures.ts` answers `POST /upload-photo` with the picked file's own
 * `uri` and serves it back as the car's `photo_url`, so the vehicle detail
 * can be photographed with a real owner photograph under the house grade —
 * through ADD PHOTO, the picker and the reload, exactly as the product runs
 * them — with no session and no server. This pins the three halves: the
 * upload is answered from the `FormData` shape `api/photos.ts` sends, both
 * vehicle routes answer with the photograph from then on (and say the plate
 * is not showing), and `DELETE` takes it away. A body that is not that shape
 * falls through to the network, the way every unmapped path here does.
