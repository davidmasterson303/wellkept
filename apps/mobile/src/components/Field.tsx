/**
 * A labelled text input.
 *
 * ── 16px is not a preference ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `fontSize` is pinned at the system's field floor and is **not** overridable
 * through `style`. Under 16px iOS zooms the page on focus and does not zoom
 * back, which strands someone mid-form at 1.3× with no way out but a reload —
 * on a form that may be writing permanent service history.
 *
 * It is a floor rather than a fixed size in principle, but there is no case yet
 * for a larger field, so the prop does not exist until there is one.
 *
 * ── A placeholder is not a label ────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * VoiceOver reads a placeholder as the field's *value* when the field is empty,
 * and once someone types it is gone entirely — so a screen-reader user
 * re-reading the form finds unlabelled boxes containing their own data. The
 * visible `label` is therefore also the accessible name, and a placeholder is
 * optional flavour on top.
 *
 * ⚠ Placeholder ink is `text.muted` and cannot go quieter. Nine placeholders in
 * this app shipped between 25% and 35% white — all below the 50% floor, all
 * invisible to every guard, because a JSX prop is not a StyleSheet entry.
 *
 * ── `problem` is described, not just coloured ───────────────────────────────
 *
 * The red edge is the second signal, never the only one. A colour-blind user
 * gets the sentence; everyone gets `accessibilityInvalid`.
 *
 * ── ⚠ 12 Sep · focus is cyan, and so is the caret ───────────────────────────
 *
 * The brief's studio paragraph: *"Fields share the geometry, cyan hairline on
 * focus."* B7 gives cyan three jobs — *"focus, active rule and refresh ramp"*
 * — and ends *"no system blue"*. A field here had no focus state at all, and
 * the one thing that did change when it took focus was the caret, which iOS
 * draws in **system blue** unless told otherwise. So the only focus signal on
 * the phone was the one hue the brief bans, and the critique saw it on the
 * service history's search field (round 30).
 *
 * `selectionColor` is the caret *and* the selection on iOS (`cursorColor` is
 * Android's, and is set too so neither platform falls back to its own blue);
 * the stroke steps to `brand.accent` while the input has focus, and back to
 * the hairline on blur. A problem outranks focus: a field that is both wrong
 * and being edited keeps its sodium edge, because that is the signal the
 * sentence beneath it is about.

        B4 names fields explicitly — *"buttons, fields, chips, bubbles,

        the delete-confirmation field square in three consecutive rounds.

        `CutSurface` paints the ground and the 45° corner behind the input; the
        `TextInput` above it goes transparent so the SVG shows through. That is
        the same arrangement `Button` uses, and it has the same consequence for
        the contrast audit: `CutSurface` declares its own ground with
        `auditSurface`, without which every field's typed ink would be measured
        against the page rather than against the well it actually sits on.

      surface, and the audit walks `backgroundColor` down the ancestor chain.

      reason — but a field is the one control where the *typed text* is the
      thing that must stay legible, so it keeps the property the audit reads
      natively and the cut is drawn over it. Belt and braces, deliberately.
