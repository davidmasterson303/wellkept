/**
 * A tab root's frame: the large title, whatever stays pinned under it, and the
 * collapse that turns the title into the mono nav title once the content has
 * scrolled.
 *
 * ── ⚠ B8, the half that was given up on 6 Sep ───────────────────────────────
 *
 * Locked brief B8: *"condensed large titles collapse to mono"*. `ScreenTitle`
 * drew the 34pt half in the screen and its docblock records why the platform's
 * own version — `headerLargeTitle` — could not be used: UIKit collapses the
 * title against the first scroll view it finds, and three of the four roots pin
 * a segment rail, a search field or a context line *above* their scroller. The
 * native title drew straight over them.
 *
 * So the collapse is the screen's own. The band under the status bar holds two
 * titles — the condensed 34pt one and the mono nav one — and the band's height
 * animates between the two heights as `collapsed` flips. Everything pinned
 * beneath the band (the rail, the scan button, the Advisor's "About" line)
 * moves with it, which is what a large title collapsing *looks* like, and the
 * screen's scroller needs to sign nothing but `onScroll`.
 *
 * ── ⚠ Why a threshold rather than a scroll-tracked height ────────────────────
 *
 * The obvious version binds the band's height to the scroll offset, so it
 * shrinks under the finger. It cannot: the band is *above* the scroller in
 * layout, and shrinking it by `s` moves the scroller up by `s` at the same
 * moment the scroller's own content has moved up by `s`. The content travels at
 * twice the finger, which reads as the list slipping. The alternative — an
 * absolutely-positioned band translating over an inset scroller — needs every
 * child screen to carry the inset, and two of them pin a search field *inside*
 * the content, which would be left behind by the translation.
 *
 * A threshold has neither problem. The band flips once the content has moved a
 * little (`COLLAPSE_AT`) and flips back once it is near the top (`EXPAND_AT`),
 * and the height change is a 180ms ease rather than a value the finger is
 * driving. Two thresholds, not one, so a reading that sits on the line does not
 * flap.
 *
 * ── ⚠ A pushed instance draws no large title ────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `Service` and `Plan` are each a root *and* a pushed screen — the car's hub
 * pushes them onto the dossier stack, where they arrive with a native header
 * and a back control. There the header already carries the mono title (see
 * `rootTitle` in `RootNavigator`), so the band would be a second name for one
 * screen. `canGoBack()` is the same question `rootTitle` asks, and the pushed
 * instance renders only the pinned block and the content.
 *
 * ── ⚠ 11 Sep · the band is a plate on three roots ───────────────────────────
 *
 * Service, Plan and Advisor name a `plate`, and the band draws that night
 * behind the large title — full-bleed under the status bar, the name over its
 * lower third, one 8pt cut bottom-right — and takes it away with the title as
 * the band collapses, so the mono nav title sits on graphite like a native
 * header's. `MastheadPlate` carries the argument, the frames and the rule that
 * lets a title be printed on a photograph here. The band's *height* does not
 * change for a plate: `AccountControl` floats on the nav row from outside the
 * navigator, and air added above the title would leave ACCOUNT alone in the
 * plate's lit upper half.
 *
 * ── Outside a navigator ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Every screen suite mounts its screen bare. Both context reads return nothing
 * there, and both have an obviously right answer: no inset, and a root.
