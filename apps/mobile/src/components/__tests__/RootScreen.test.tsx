 * scroll. Every half of that can fail without an error: the two titles can
 * both be visible (two names on one screen), the collapse can be wired to
 * nothing (a `onScroll` nobody spreads), the compact title can carry the wrong
 * face (`fontWeight` without a `fontFamily` renders San Francisco), and a
 * pushed instance can draw the large title under a native header that already
 * names the screen.
 *
 * The masthead plate (11 Sep) adds four more of the same shape — see the
 * block at the foot of the file.
