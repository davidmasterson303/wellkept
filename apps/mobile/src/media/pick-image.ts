/**
 * The one place that will import `expo-image-picker`.
 *
 * ⚠ **Two callers now, and that is why this is `pick-image` rather than
 * `pick-invoice-image`.** Invoices came first; vehicle photographs arrived on
 * 15 Aug. Adding a second module that imported the picker would have broken the
 * invariant this file exists to hold — see below — so the seam widened instead
 * of multiplying.
 *
 * ── Why it is a seam and not just an import ─────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `expo-image-picker` is a **native** module. The development client currently
 * installed on the simulator was built before it was a dependency, so importing
 * it anywhere in the module graph crashes the app on launch — the working setup
 * would be gone before its replacement exists. Build `29b4d76f` (5 Aug) is what
 * contains it.
 *
 * Keeping the import behind one small module means exactly one file changes
 * when that build installs, and `InvoiceScanScreen` never has to know a native
 * module exists. It takes `pickImage` as a prop for the same reason
 * `GarageScreen` takes `onOpenVehicle`.
 *
 * Wired 5 Aug once build `29b4d76f` installed — verified by reading
 * `ExpoImagePicker` out of the installed bundle's dylib before importing it,
 * because importing a module the binary lacks crashes the app on launch.
 *
 * ── Two decisions, not plumbing ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *   - **`null` means dismissed, and dismissed is not an error.** The screen
 *     returns to idle silently. Only a genuine failure throws.
 *   - **Quality is reduced at capture.** `MAX_FILE_SIZE` is 10 MB and a
 *     full-resolution iPhone photograph approaches it, but the real reason is
 *     the M235i photo: a 2.3 MB original that has never once decoded on this
 *     simulator. Sending a smaller image is the fix that was not available for
 *     that one, and the extractor reads text — it does not need 12 megapixels.
 *
 * ── Why the library is a first-class source and not a fallback ──────────────
 *
 * `cc-product-0001`'s pitch is photographing a receipt in the shop's car park,
 * so the camera leads. But a great many invoices arrive as an emailed PDF or a
 * photo taken days ago, and **the simulator has no camera at all** — so a
 * camera-only flow could never be exercised on the machine this is developed
 * on. Both sources return the same `InvoiceFile`, so the screen does not care
 * which was used.
 *
 * ── ⚠ 12 Sep · the invoice's camera path no longer comes through here ───────
 *
 * B9 gave the scan its own viewfinder (`components/Viewfinder.tsx`, on
 * `expo-camera`), so `InvoiceScanScreen` opens on a live frame and captures
 * from it; `pickInvoiceImage('camera')` — the system camera sheet — is kept
 * because the seam is the picker's, and nothing on the phone calls it for an
 * invoice any more. The library path is unchanged and is still what the
 * simulator exercises. The two sources encode at one figure, `INVOICE_QUALITY`
 * in `invoice-image.ts`, which is where the number moved so the viewfinder
 * could not drift from it.

/**
 * A photograph of the car itself.
 *
 * ── Why the quality is lower than the invoice's ─────────────────────────────
 *
 * ⚠ **A vehicle photo has a hard server-side ceiling that an invoice does not.**
 * `MAX_STORED_PHOTO_BYTES` is 1.5 MB, and it exists because this account still
 * holds a 3000×4000 / 2.3 MB original that has never decoded on a device — the
 * plate's timeout exists solely to escape it. `MAX_FILE_SIZE` for a document is
 * 10 MB, so an invoice has room this does not.
 *
 * On web the browser downscales before upload. **The phone cannot**: there is
 * no canvas, and `expo-image-manipulator` — the module that would cap a
 * dimension properly — is not in this build and adding it is a native change
 * costing one of the month's cloud builds.
 *
 * So the lever available today is the encoder's quality, and 0.45 is it. A
 * 12-megapixel capture lands under the ceiling at that setting in the ordinary
 * case, and the ceiling is not raised to meet it: raising it would reintroduce
 * exactly the undecodable-original bug for the next car.
 *
 * ⚠ **This is a probability, not a guarantee**, and the flow is built to say so
 * — the server returns its refusal reason and the screen shows it, rather than
 * failing generically. A guaranteed dimension cap needs that native module.

      ── This line is the fix for the 5 Aug end-to-end failure ────────────────

      **iPhones shoot HEIC by default**, and PHPicker hands back whatever the
      asset already is. `expo-image-picker`'s own iOS source re-encodes most
      formats but passes HEIC through untouched:

          case UTType.heic.identifier:
            return (rawData, ".heic")          // ImageUtils.swift:145

      The mime type is derived from that extension, so the client received
      `image/heic`, which is not in `ALLOWED_DOCUMENT_TYPES` — and the upload
      was refused before it left the phone with "That file type cannot be read".

      That was never a simulator quirk. Every stock simulator photo is HEIC
      because every real iPhone photo is, so it would have failed for the first
      person to photograph an invoice.

      `Compatible` asks PHPicker for the most compatible representation, which
      on iOS transcodes HEIC to JPEG before handing it over — done by the
      system, on the device, needing no extra native module and therefore **no
      second cloud build**. The registered type identifier becomes
      `public.jpeg`, the switch above falls to its `default:` branch, and the
      file arrives as `.jpg`.

      Widening the allowlist to accept HEIC was the alternative and was
      rejected: Gemini does accept HEIC, so it would have worked, but it would
      store an Apple-only container browsers cannot render — moving the problem
      into the web document library rather than solving it.
