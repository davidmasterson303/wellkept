 * The mobile token layer — Tappet v8, native.
 *
 * ── ⚠ 5 Sep: the two-hue collapse reached this file ────────────────────────
 *
 * Until today it had not. The 4–5 September design work moved web onto two
 * hues — **sodium is the warning axis, cold cyan is information and the build
 * ramp, and good news is off-white ink rather than a colour** — and touched
 * `apps/mobile` in exactly zero commits. The health ramp crossed anyway,
 * because it lives in `@tappet/core/health-band` and the screens read it at
 * runtime; nothing else did. So the phone spent a day rendering the previous
 * system beside a ramp from the new one, which is the half-applied state
 * `CLAUDE.md` §6 is about, and it was invisible because
 * `retired-palette-literals.test.ts` scanned `app`, `components` and `hooks`
 * and never looked here. That scan now covers this directory.
 *
 * What moved: `register.accent`, `status.confirm`, `status.dangerText` and its
 * two washes, the whole `build` ramp, and the red fills below. What did not:
 * the surface ladder, the type scale, the spacing — none of which the collapse
 * touched on web either.
 *
 * Source: `HANDOFF_mobile_baseline.md` (14 Aug) and the `Mobile Baseline`
 * board, cross-checked against `app/globals.css`. **Nothing here is invented
 * for mobile.** Where a value could be read off the repository it was, and
 * where the handoff and the tree disagreed the tree won — that rule caught two
 * claims in the board's first draft, both describing the design-system export
 * rather than this codebase.
 *
 * ── The rule this file exists to make enforceable ───────────────────────────
 *
 * `$rules.colorLiterals`: **no StyleSheet in `apps/mobile` may contain a colour
 * literal**, including a computed or conditional one. Twelve screens carried
 * 232 of them, which is why nothing about the app could be reviewed — a screen
 * cannot be judged when every screen is a different product.
 *
 * The one legitimate exception is a colour the *data* chooses: a health band is
 * owned by `@tappet/core/health-band` and read at runtime, not stored here.
 * The phone must not hold a second opinion about what "Fair" looks like.

 * five-step ladder, mobile sat on a flat neutral black with no ladder at all.
 * Depth on web is not decoration, it is the ladder doing its job.

   * of this repo's audit: `contrast.test.tsx` measures disabled labels like

   * clears that at 3.31:1 on `surface.disabled` and nothing else.
   *
   * B1 set button labels in mono caps at 13pt. That is not large text, the
   * requirement became 4.5:1, and four screens failed at once — the disabled
   * sign-in, sign-up and both add-a-car states.
   *
   * The exemption was available and is deliberately not taken. A disabled
   * primary is the first thing three of those screens render, so it is the
   * state a new user reads *before* anything else; "the spec permits it to be
   * unreadable" is a poor answer to that. `#8A857F` measures **4.62:1** on

 *
 * ── ⚠ 23 Aug: "happen to share hues" was doing a lot of work ────────────────
 *
 * This docblock used to say `attention` and `critical` "happen to share hues
 * with two bands". They did not share hues — they were **the same hex**:
 * `attention` was `#E0A468`, which is the health ramp's `warn`, and `critical`
 * was `#E08882`, which is its `bad`. So the sentence asserting these were not a
 * second copy of the ramp sat directly above a second copy of the ramp.
 *
 * Design's ruling: **attention is `#FB923C`**, and the two families are meant to
 * rhyme without matching, because a gauge reading and a status chip are
 * different claims — sharing a colour makes a 61 look like something you can
 * dismiss. The garage bay had that live: a dial reading in warn amber with a
 * recall chip beside it in the same amber the dial uses for Critical.
 *
 * `critical: '#E08882'` is **gone** rather than recoloured. It had no call
 * sites — the critical chip reads `dangerText` and the banners read
 * `criticalFill`/`criticalBorder`. A dead token holding a colliding hex is how
 * a collision comes back.
 *
 * ⚠ **5 Sep: the reds left, and `attention` did not move.** `dangerText` was
 * `#F87171` and `danger` was `#DC2626` — a red family sitting beside a sodium
 * one, which is the second hue the collapse exists to remove. They are now
 * `--critical` and a solid sodium, and `attention` keeps `#FB923C` because it
 * was already on the surviving axis. The two families still rhyme without
 * matching, which is the ruling above and is unaffected by the collapse.
 *
 * The delete button was the accidental beneficiary: `text.primary` on `#DC2626`
 * measured **4.36:1**, under AA, and nothing was asserting it. On the sodium
 * fill it is 5.68:1.

  /*
    ── ⚠ 6 Sep: the display and mono slots, under the locked iOS brief ────────

    Everything above this comment is the scale the app shipped with, and it is
    **one family doing every job** — Inter for titles, for values, for state
    words, for indices, with the serif on top for a screen's name. The locked
    brief (`design-loop/mobile-ios/brief.md`, B1) replaces that with the
    system's three voices: condensed grotesk for names and heads, mono for
    every value/date/index/state/tab label, Inter for body, serif for the
    wordmark alone.

    The Inter tokens are **kept rather than deleted**, because body copy is
    still Inter and roughly half the app's strings are body. What must not
    happen is `type.title` continuing to set a screen's name — that is what
    `display` is for now, and `type.editorial` is for the wordmark only.

    ⚠ Every token below names a **face**, never a bare weight. See `fonts.ts`:
    React Native resolves a family by filename and will render San Francisco in
    silence if the face is missing. That is the whole reason these are functions
    rather than strings.
