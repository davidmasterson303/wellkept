      ── Whose garage, and the three faults this one query had ────────────────

      Found 22 Aug by entering a VIN that another account already held. The
      user was told "This vehicle is already in your garage", waited two
      seconds, and was **bounced to the garage with no message at all** — the
      redirect went to a dashboard `authorizeVehicleAccess` correctly refuses.

      Three separate faults, one query:

      1. **`client` is the service role, so this searched every account.** The
         VIN column is `UNIQUE` across the whole table, so the row that came
         back was as likely to be a stranger's as the caller's.
      2. **The message asserted ownership the query had not established.** "In
         your garage" is a claim about *whose* car it is, and the filter that
         would have made it true was missing.
      3. **It handed the caller another account's `vehicleId`**, which the form
         then navigated to. Authorization held — nothing leaked, and the bounce
         *is* the authorization working — but the dead end was manufactured
         here, two layers earlier.

      Now scoped to the caller. `.eq('user_id', session.userId)` on a
      service-role client is the explicit filter `requireCaller`'s docblock
      argues for: RLS is the control, and an explicit filter means a policy
      regression surfaces as a bug in one path rather than a cross-tenant read.

      ⚠ **No `vehicleId` here, deliberately.** That field is what the form
      redirects on, and there is nowhere to send this person: the vehicle is
      not theirs to open. Returning it produced the silent bounce.

      ⚠ Which is a product limitation this does not fix. A `UNIQUE` VIN means a
      sold car can never be added by its new owner, and the honest answer for
      them is a support conversation rather than a self-service path. Changing

 * Everything a new vehicle needs that is not required to own it.
 *
 * ── Why this exists ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Onboarding used to do all of this *before* the user reached their garage:
 * the vehicle insert, a Google image lookup, a ~23s Gemini research call, a
 * second Gemini call for the health summary, and then a hardcoded two-second
 * pause. Measured 28 Jul, that is 30-60s of spinner on the first thing anyone
 * ever does in this product — and with no deadline on the model calls it was
 * unbounded. An App Store reviewer creates an account, adds a vehicle, and
 * judges; a multi-minute spinner reads as broken.
 *
 * The VIN decode already yields year, make, model, trim, engine and
 * drivetrain in ~0.6s. That is everything "I own this car" needs. The research
 * makes the dossier better; nothing about owning the car depends on it.
 *
 * ── Why it is a server action and not a background job ──────────────────────
 *
 * §11 records the wishlist recompute being fire-and-forget on a serverless
 * platform, where work started after the response "may be frozen along with
 * it". So this is deliberately **not** started and abandoned during
 * onboarding. The dashboard calls it as a real request with a real lifecycle,
 * once, when it sees `research_status = 'pending'`. The work is owned by a
 * request that is actually waiting for it.
 *
 * That also gives failure somewhere to live: the row goes to `'failed'`, the
 * dashboard shows it, and the user can press retry. A silent empty dossier is
 * the §21 provenance problem in a new costume — a UI implying data it does
 * not have.
 */
/**
 * Just the research status, for a client that is waiting on it.
 *
 * ── Why this exists ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `enrichVehicle` both *starts* the research and *reports* it, and on 22 Aug
 * that turned out to be two jobs. A real run wrote a complete dossier and 24
 * NHTSA recalls in about sixty seconds, and the browser was told it had
 * failed: the request outlived its response, the action returned no body, and
 * `VehicleResearchStatus` read `.success` off `undefined`.
 *
 * The work was never the problem. **The answer had nowhere to arrive.** A
 * client that waits on one long response has exactly one chance to hear the
 * outcome, and that chance is spent on the leg most likely to be cut. The
 * status is in the database the whole time.
 *
 * So the client keeps starting the work with `enrichVehicle` — §11's rule
 * stands, the work needs a request that owns it — and stops depending on its
 * return value. This is what it reads instead.
 *
 * ⚠ Cheap on purpose: one authorized read of one column, no model call, no
 * write. It is polled every few seconds by a page somebody is looking at, and
 * anything heavier here becomes a cost that scales with patience.

 * ── What the row owns, and what goes with it ────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The messages are `message_history`, a column *on* the row — there is no
 * messages table — so deleting the row deletes the thread. The documents
 * uploaded into it are rows in `consultant_documents` keyed by `session_id`,
 * and they are removed here explicitly rather than left to the cascade the
 * migration file declares. ⚠ Not because the cascade is doubted, exactly:
 * `session_id` is a live foreign key (checked through PostgREST on 11 Sep),
 * but its ON DELETE action is not visible from outside the SQL editor, and
 * this database has disagreed with its migration files four times. An
 * explicit delete is correct under every reading — with a cascade it is
 * redundant, without one it is what stops the row delete failing on the
 * constraint.
 *
 * ── ⚠ The storage objects are deliberately left alone ──────────────────────
 *
 * Each `consultant_documents.file_url` points at an object in the private
 * `vehicle-documents` bucket, and it looks like the row's to remove. It is
 * not only the row's: when the advisor recognises an attachment as an
 * invoice, `processConsultantInvoiceToMaintenance` records **the same path**
 * on a `vehicle_documents` row — the garage's copy of that invoice. Removing
 * the file here would leave that record pointing at nothing, and the failure
 * is silent until the owner opens it. Account deletion already sweeps the
 * bucket by vehicle prefix (`lib/account-data.ts`), so an orphaned attachment
 * costs storage until then; a deleted invoice costs the record. Live on
 * 11 Sep: zero `consultant_documents` rows exist, so nothing is orphaned by
 * this decision today.
 *
 * Both deletes are scoped to the authorised vehicle as well as the id, for
 * the reason given on the rename.

     * The write intent was never right for the demo path: every mutation below
     * is already inside `if (!isDemoVehicle)`. In demo mode this function calls
     * Gemini and returns a string. It writes nothing, so it needs read access.
     *
     * ── Why this is derived and not taken from params ─────────────────────
     *
     * `params.isDemo` is client-supplied and must never decide an
     * authorization or persistence question. Trusting it for the intent would
     * let a caller pass isDemo:true for a *real* vehicle and downgrade the
     * check to a demo read. Trusting it for the guard below would be worse in
     * the other direction: isDemo:false on a demo vehicle would enter the
     * persistence branch and hand a client-controlled sessionId to the
     * service-role client. Until now the unconditional 'write' happened to
     * mask that second path by rejecting demo vehicles outright — relaxing the
     * intent without also fixing the guard would have opened it.
     *
     * `isDemoVehicleId` is a pure check against a hardcoded id list, and it is
     * the same function authorizeVehicleAccess itself uses, so the two cannot
     * disagree about what a demo vehicle is.

        only unauthenticated path to a model in the application, and about $11 a
        month of exposure to anybody holding the URL. That arrangement gets
        *worse* as the product succeeds, because prospects are now the largest
        unpaid population in it.

        It returns a pre-written answer instead. `packages/core/src/demo-answers.ts`
        holds them, grounded in the three seeded cars' real records, and a guard
        there fails if that module ever grows a fetch or a model import.

        ⚠ **`null` is returned rather than the closest sample.** A matcher that
        finds the nearest answer answers a question nobody asked, and a
        plausible answer to the wrong question is indistinguishable from a good
        one. The caller says the demo does not cover it; the questions it does
        cover are on screen.

        ⚠ `isSample` travels with the answer so the client can label it. A
        pre-written answer presented as one a model just produced is the same
        defect as the scan sweep that depicted an examination nobody ran — and
        this file has removed three of those this month.

        The demo budget is not deleted: `checkDemoBudget` still guards the front
        door, which does call a model. It is simply no longer reachable from
        here, because nothing here spends.

Treat the invoice line items above as completed, documented work. An owner who
has uploaded invoices has a documented history, and the assessment must not
describe their records as absent.

Based on the owner's provided service history, provide a concise health assessment in JSON format with:
- healthScore (1-100 integer based on provided records, not assumptions)
- summary (1-2 sentences about their vehicle's condition based on provided history)
- redFlags (array of critical issues mentioned in their service records)
- maintenanceStatus (status of provided service records and upcoming items)
- issuesOverview (summary of owner-reported and addressed issues)

Do not report on recalls. Whether this vehicle's recalls have been checked at
all is a fact about our lookup, not about the car, and we write that sentence
ourselves — see \`recall_status\` below. A model-authored "no recalls to date"
would be rendered verbatim beside a vehicle NHTSA was never asked about.
- recommendations (array of 2-3 actions based on their provided service history)

Important: Frame all recommendations as "based on your provided service history". Only reference issues the owner has documented or common known issues. Leave fields empty/null if no data is available. Do not make assumptions about hidden problems.

Format as valid JSON only, no markdown.`;

      score stays at 70 because it is a documented neutral rather than a claim
      — `advice-range.ts` carries that argument — and the copy no longer
      dresses it as good news.

      treats any written status as evidence and would have rendered

      ── ⚠ FN-01 · the prompt asks camelCase and this read snake_case ─────────

      **Every health score Tappet has ever generated was 70.** The prompt
      above asks for `healthScore`, `redFlags`, `maintenanceStatus`,
      `recallStatus` and `issuesOverview`; this block read `health_score`,
      `red_flags` and the rest in snake_case. `healthData.health_score` was
      therefore *always* `undefined`, and the line that followed set 70 on every
      successful generation. `redFlags` met the same fate and was forced to `[]`.

      Confirmed against the live API on 23 Aug: the M235i returns
      `health_score: 70`, `red_flags: []`, and **no `maintenance_status`,
      `recall_status` or `issues_overview` keys at all** — because
      `healthData = JSON.parse(...)` replaced the whole defaults object rather
      than filling gaps in it, so the three fields the model never supplied under
      those names were not merely wrong, they were absent.

      The seeded demo Accord reads 74 only because that number came from
      `20260314142241_seed_demo_vehicles.sql`. So it was never "every vehicle is
      70" — it was "every vehicle this function has ever assessed is 70", which
      is worse, because the constant was indistinguishable from a reading.

      Three things changed, and all three were needed:

      1. **`extractJSON`, not `JSON.parse`.** It is defined at the top of this
         file and it strips the ``` fences that "Format as valid JSON only, no
         markdown" does not reliably prevent. Every other extraction site here
         already uses it.
      2. **An explicit camelCase → snake_case map**, the same shape as the mod
         detail parser further down this file. The two spellings are now written
         next to each other, which is the only arrangement where a rename to one
         of them is visible.
      3. **The score is nullable end to end.** `70` remains a documented neutral
         on the **parse-failure** path — `advice-range.ts` carries that argument
         — but it must never be what gets stored when the model actually
         answered. A number the model did not produce, stored in the column a
         gauge reads, is the shape of defect this whole codebase is written
         against.

      ⚠ The merge is field-by-field into `healthData` rather than a wholesale
      replacement. That is what keeps `recall_status` — which routes through
      `healthClaim` so an unchecked vehicle gets the same "we cannot say"
      sentence here and on the tile — from being silently dropped by a model
      response that omits it.

      written for a 'moderate' owner, every time, and an owner who said 'stock'
      got mod analysis at all. That is the reported disagreement between the two

/**
 * Turn the modifications surface on or off for one car.
 *
 * ── Why this exists, and why it is not optional ─────────────────────────────
 *
 * Onboarding asks one yes/no about modifications, and answering "not
 * interested" hides the whole surface — the dossier tab, the ladder, the build
 * dial. That answer is given in the first sixty seconds of using the product,
 * before anyone knows what they are switching off, and it used to be
 * **irreversible**: nothing anywhere could set it back.
 *
 * A choice with no way back is not a preference, it is a trap. It also made the
 * onboarding question far weightier than it reads — David flagged wanting "some
 * subtle CTA if user wants to bring it back later" the moment he proposed the
 * hiding, and this is that.
 *
 * ── The enum, and why "yes" is stored as `mild` ─────────────────────────────
 *
 * `performance_mindedness` is a Postgres enum `('stock','mild','aggressive')`.
 * A truer word for "interested" would need `ALTER TYPE` and a hand-applied
 * migration, which is not worth spending on a label. `mild` means interested;
 * `aggressive` is legacy and read-only. Nothing branches on the difference —
 * `showsModifications` in `@tappet/core/mod-progression` is the whole rule,
 * and this writes the values that rule reads.

      RLS entirely. Three writes downstream keyed on it:

      over their document row, and had the victim's `file_url` written into
      their own vehicle and returned to them.

      The residual risk the audit named is exactly this shape: *a second
      client-supplied id inside a function whose first id is correctly
      authorized.* One authorization does not cover two ids.

      `authorizeVehicleScopedRow` exists for precisely this and

    const prompt = `You are analyzing an automotive service document. First validate this is an automotive service invoice, then extract all data.

STEP 1: DOCUMENT TYPE VALIDATION
Determine if this is an automotive service invoice by checking for:
- Shop/garage name and address
- Vehicle information (year, make, model, VIN)
- Labor and/or parts line items with automotive terminology
- Service descriptions related to vehicle maintenance or repair

If this is NOT an automotive service invoice (e.g., restaurant receipt, utility bill, grocery receipt, etc.), set "is_valid_invoice" to false.

STEP 2: VEHICLE VALIDATION (EXTREMELY LENIENT)
CRITICAL: Default to vehicle_mismatch = FALSE. Only flag vehicle_mismatch if ALL of these conditions are met:
1. You can clearly read complete vehicle information (year AND make AND model) from the invoice
2. The extracted vehicle information SIGNIFICANTLY contradicts the expected vehicle (different make or completely different model)
3. There is NO possibility of a trim level, variant, or version difference

Expected vehicle: ${vehicle ? `${vehicle.year} ${vehicle.make} ${vehicle.model}` : 'Unknown'}

EXTREMELY LENIENT RULES:
- If vehicle info is NOT visible or readable → vehicle_mismatch = FALSE
- If only partial vehicle info is visible (e.g., only VIN, only year, or only make) → vehicle_mismatch = FALSE
- If color doesn't match → IGNORE (vehicle_mismatch = FALSE)
- If year is within 1 year → vehicle_mismatch = FALSE (could be model year vs registration year)
- If make matches but model has variations (e.g., "M235i" vs "M2" vs "2 Series") → vehicle_mismatch = FALSE (assume trim/variant)
- If make matches but model adds extra detail (e.g., "M235i xDrive" vs "M235i") → vehicle_mismatch = FALSE
- ONLY set vehicle_mismatch = TRUE for major contradictions like: Honda vs BMW, Civic vs M235i, 2015 vs 2020 (5+ year gap)

DEFAULT TO FALSE. When in doubt, assume the invoice is correct.

STEP 3: MULTI-PAGE INVOICE HANDLING
CRITICAL: This may be a multi-page invoice. Use the invoice/estimate number to group related pages.
- If you see an invoice number (like "1166" or "Estimate #1166"), note it
- Page 1 typically shows ITEMIZED labor with individual service descriptions
- Page 2 typically shows PARTS with part numbers, plus a SUMMARY labor total
- DO NOT extract the summary "Labor" line from page 2 if page 1 already has itemized labor
- DO NOT extract "Tax" more than once - it should only appear on the final total
- If you see a large unitemized "Labor" line (e.g. $6,985.98), check if page 1 already broke this down into individual services

STEP 4: EXTRACT ALL LINE ITEMS
Extract items from ALL pages, but avoid duplicates:
1. From "Labor" section: Extract individual service descriptions (NOT summary totals)
2. From "Parts" section: Extract all parts with part numbers
3. From "Misc" section: Extract fees, supplies, etc.
4. Tax: DO NOT EXTRACT TAX LINE ITEMS - tax will be handled separately

CRITICAL: DO NOT extract tax as a line item. Skip any line items labeled "Tax" or "Sales Tax".

DEDUPLICATION RULES:
- Skip any line that says just "Labor" with a large dollar amount if you already extracted itemized labor services
- Skip all tax lines - DO NOT include tax as a line item
- Skip duplicate totals or subtotals

        through to the write with `total_cost: 0` and
        `extraction_status: 'completed'`, and returned `{ success: true }`.

        Three things followed from that, and the third is the one that matters:

        1. The UI said the upload worked. The maintenance list showed nothing.
        2. `extraction_status: 'completed'` meant **nothing would ever retry
           it**. The invoice was gone as far as this product was concerned.
        3. **The advisor's own guard was defeated**, because `0` is a number:

               if (typeof data.total_cost !== 'number') return null;

           The comment two lines above that guard states the intent — *"Older
           documents have no `total_cost` and are skipped entirely rather than
           reported as $0, which would be a confident lie about a real bill."*
           A failed extraction wrote a numeric `0`, the guard passed, and asked
           *"what did my last service cost?"* the advisor answered **"$0"** for
           a $1,519.44 bill.

        So the failure is now a failure. Nothing is written, the caller is told,
        and the document is left in a state a retry can find.

      ── The health score is refreshed here, on the server ────────────────────

      It used to be refreshed by `components/DocumentUploadDialog.tsx` calling
      `generateVehicleHealthSummary` after the upload returned — in the **web
      client**. So the mobile app, which posts to the same endpoint, never
      triggered it, and a phone could file five service records and be told its
      car had a "complete lack of documented maintenance". Observed on a real
      run, 5 Aug.

      A capability living in one client's component is a capability the second
      client silently lacks. That is this codebase's most repeated defect —
      `VehicleCard`'s unauthorized delete, the health band, the context-kind
      labels — and the fix is always the same: move it to the one place both
      callers already go through.

      **Not awaited, and that is a correction to this same commit.** Awaiting
      it stacked a second Gemini call onto a request that already spends ~8s in
      vision, against a serverless ceiling this project has no configured
      override for. Timing out there would fail an upload whose document and
      line items are *already written* — reporting a filing that actually
      succeeded as a failure, which is the exact class of defect the last three
      rounds were spent removing. A stale score is recoverable; a lost
      confirmation is not.

      This matches the precedent in `app/api/v1/wishlist/complete/route.ts`,
      which recomputes stats the same way and for the same stated reason:
      derived display data must not make the user wait on a model.

      Best-effort is honest here rather than lazy, because the *other* half of
      this fix does the heavy lifting — `generateVehicleHealthSummary` now reads
      `maintenance_line_items`, so any later recompute (a web visit, the 24h
      cache expiring) produces the right answer instead of the wrong one.

      **Failure never fails the upload.** The invoice is stored and its line
      items are written by this point — the same judgement `runVehicleResearch`
      makes at line 444 about a missing health summary.

 * That is wrong** — `generateQuoteRequestV2` does, in this file, which is

5. Provide ranges to account for shop-to-shop variation
6. Base labor rates: Estimate typical rates for the region (e.g., $80-120/hr for average areas, $120-180/hr for high-cost areas like major cities)

/**
 * ── ⚠ Not exported, and that is the fix (SEC-02 / FN-04) ────────────────────
 *
 * `app/actions.ts` carries `'use server'`, so **every export in it compiles
 * into a publicly invokable POST endpoint**. Seventy-one of them.
 *
 * This function is an internal step of `generateQuoteRequestV2`, and as an
 * export it was also a **free LLM proxy**: no `requireSession`, no
 * `authorizeVehicleAccess`, no `checkRateLimit`, no `checkMonthlyBudget`, no
 * usage recording. Every prompt field is caller-supplied, `serviceItems` has no
 * length cap, and `withRetry` runs it up to three times.
 *
 * ⚠ **The audit recommended deleting it, on the reading that nothing calls it.
 * That is wrong** — `generateQuoteRequestV2` does, in this file, which is
 * presumably what the grep matched and read as the definition. Deleting it
 * would have broken the quote flow.
 *
 * Dropping the `export` is the actual fix and it is strictly better: the
 * capability stays, the endpoint goes, and the authorization that matters is
 * the one its caller already performs on a vehicle it owns.

/**
 * Phase 2.98c — record that someone took the quote pull.
 *
 * ── Why a server action and not an analytics call ───────────────────────────
 *
 * There is no analytics product in this application. Not "not wired up" — none:
 * no PostHog, no Plausible, no event pipeline. The only durable observability
 * is the structured logger, which lands in the platform's function logs.
 *
 * So this is deliberately the smallest thing that answers the question 2.98
 * exists to ask — *does anyone click this?* — using only what is already here.
 * It is a counter, not a funnel. When 2.97d brings a real instrumentation
 * substrate (it is a ship gate for the front door, so it must), this should be
 * replaced by it rather than grown.
 *
 * **It records intent, not conversion.** A click here means the affordance was
 * taken, not that a quote was generated — `generateQuoteRequestV2` already logs
 * that end separately, and reading the two together is what gives a rate.
 *
 * Never throws and never blocks the UI: the dialog opens whether or not this
 * write succeeds. An instrumentation failure that stops a user getting quotes
 * would be a strictly worse product than an unmeasured click.

      ── The ceiling is what the owner asked for, not what they have earned ────

      This filtered `getModTier(m.difficulty) === tier` against
      `vehicles.earned_tier` — **exactly** that tier rather than up to it.

      Measured on the live database, 7 Aug: every vehicle sits at
      `earned_tier: 'mild'` bar one, so the WRX owner — who answered
      "track-ready, high-performance builds" in onboarding — was shown **one
      modification out of five**. Its downpipe, brake kit, sway bars and rod
      bolts were all filtered out as too difficult for a tier they had no way to
      leave: you advance by completing mods, and `modification_tracking` is
      empty across the entire product, so nobody ever advanced.

      A progression that cannot progress is a gate.

      **And there is no ceiling either** — David, 7 Aug: a build is a continuum,
      not a set of end states, so nothing is withheld on the strength of one
      onboarding answer. `performance_mindedness` decides *whether* there is a
      mods surface at all and, through `nextRungs`, what surfaces first.
      `earned_tier` marks progress rather than withholding.

      `tier` still scopes the tracking and cache reads below, because those are
      genuinely per-tier records. Only the *visible list* is widened, so a mod
      above the earned tier renders without cached analysis rather than not at
      all — "No analysis yet" is a true statement and an invisible mod is not.
