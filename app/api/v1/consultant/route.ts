/**
 * Ask the advisor — the flow carrying the 4.2 Minimum Functionality argument.
 *
 * ── Why this route can be thin ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Because `sendConsultantMessage` stopped taking the vehicle's entire history
 * as parameters. Until `a0e9894` it did, which made it unusable as a public
 * API twice over: a phone cannot upload a car's whole record on every message,
 * and the prompt was assembled from whatever the caller posted. The context is
 * now derived from `vehicleId` server-side, so what is left for a caller to
 * supply is a vehicle, a thread, and a question.
 *
 * This route therefore **delegates rather than reimplementing**. Prompt
 * assembly, wishlist command parsing, performance updates and persistence all
 * live in the action and stay there. A second copy of any of that would be the
 * bug this codebase keeps finding — two implementations of one rule, drifting.
 *
 * ── Why authorization happens here as well as in the action ─────────────────
 *
 * Not redundancy. The action authorizes because it is independently reachable:
 * Next.js compiles server actions into public POST endpoints, so it must
 * defend itself and always must. This route authorizes because it needs the
 * *status code* — a denial has to come back as 401 or 404, and the action
 * returns `{ success: false, error }` with no status, as it should. Deriving
 * HTTP semantics by matching on error strings would be the fragile version of
 * this.
 *
 * One extra ownership query on a request that is about to spend one to three
 * seconds in Gemini. It is not the cost worth optimising.
