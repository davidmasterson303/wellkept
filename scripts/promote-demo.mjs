/**
 * Promote the current `main` to the public demo — and to the app's backend.
 *
 * ⚠ **Read this first if you have not run it since 17 Aug — the candidate
 * moved.** Nothing deploys from `main` any more. Both Tappet hostnames sit
 * behind their own release branch:
 *
 *     web-live   -> tappet.southmoordigital.com   App Store URL + the app's API
 *     demo-live  -> tappet-demo.davidmasterson.co   this script's target
 *
 * This script's whole method is to verify **the exact build that is about to
 * become the demo, before it becomes the demo** — which needs that commit
 * already live somewhere. That used to be a site auto-deploying `main`. There
 * is no such site now, so the candidate is `web-live`'s hostname, and the order
 * is:
 *
 *     main  ->  web-live  ->  (verify here)  ->  demo-live
 *
 * If the candidate check fails saying the candidate is behind HEAD, that is not
 * a bug: it means `web-live` has not been merged yet, and promoting the demo
 * ahead of it would publish a build nothing has verified.
 *
 * ── The problem this solves ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * tappet-demo.davidmasterson.co is linked from David's portfolio and shown
 * to recruiters during an active job search. Two bad options were available
 * before this script existed:
 *
 *   - Point the demo domain at `main`. Every push goes live instantly,
 *     including a half-finished refactor at 11pm.
 *   - Leave the demo frozen. Safe, but it drifts: none of the design-system
 *     work is visible to anyone, so the portfolio piece slowly stops
 *     representing the product.
 *
 * So the demo builds from its own branch, `demo-live`, and this is the only
 * way that branch moves. UI improvements reach the demo on a cadence we
 * choose, and can never arrive by accident.
 *
 * ── The gate ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Everything is verified against the CI site, which already builds `main` —
 * meaning we check the *exact build* that is about to become the demo, before
 * it becomes the demo. Verifying afterwards would only tell us what we broke.
 *
 * The version check matters more than it looks. This project once read a
 * cached 200 as proof a new build was live. /api/version reports the commit
 * it was built from, so "the deploy finished" stops being an assumption.
 *
 *   node scripts/promote-demo.mjs            # dry run — checks, no merge
 *   node scripts/promote-demo.mjs --apply    # promote

  ── ⚠ Why this looks at the wrong host on purpose ──────────────────────────

  Every other check here interrogates the **candidate** — the exact build about
  to become the demo, already live on `web-live`. That is the whole reason this
  script can verify more than `promote-web` can.

  It is also why it cannot see this one. `CREWCHIEF_DEMO_SITE` is a per-site
  Netlify variable, and on `web-live` it is deliberately **unset** — that host
  is the product. So the candidate build, however healthy, tells you nothing
  about how it will render once it is serving the demo hostname.

  ── What breaks if nobody checks ───────────────────────────────────────────

  Since 22 Aug the landing CTA is gated on that variable, and its default is
  **product** — chosen so an unset variable can never put demo framing on the
  App Store listing's URL, which is the failure that actually happened with the
  masthead. The cost of that safe direction is paid here: if the variable is
  ever missing on the demo site, the recruiter host does not break, it quietly
  starts asking recruiters to **sign up**, with no error anywhere.

  Confirmed set on 22 Aug — the masthead and "Enter demo" are both live. This
  exists so that stops being something anybody has to remember.
