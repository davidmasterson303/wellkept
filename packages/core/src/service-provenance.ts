/**
 * What a service-due figure actually rests on, said out loud.
 *
 * ── Why this exists, and why it is not decoration ───────────────────────────
 *
 * This app has rendered a provenance claim it could not substantiate **twice**.
 * `ae45710` removed fabricated "AI Verified" maintenance records; an
 * unconditional "AI Extracted" badge survived that clean-up and shipped to the
 * public demo, on rows that included hand-typed completions and seeded demo
 * data. `provenance-claims.test.ts` fails the build if that returns, and its
 * instruction for doing it legitimately is the one followed here: **record
 * where the figure came from, and render the claim from that** rather than
 * writing a badge next to it.
 *
 * `evaluateSchedule` already returns `basedOnHistory`, so every claim below is
 * a function of data rather than a sentence someone chose.
 *
 * ── Why it matters more here than on a knowledge panel ──────────────────────
 *
 * Because a structured number reads as a record. "Your 60,000-mile service is
 * due: transmission fluid, spark plugs, brake fluid" is indistinguishable, to
 * an owner, from something their dealer told them — and it is a model's best
 * guess at a manufacturer schedule, compared against an odometer reading the
 * owner typed in themselves. **Structure confers authority**, and the two
 * inputs here have not earned it. The label is how the screen stays honest
 * while still being useful.
 *
 * David's decision, 7 Aug: confirm the mileage, then assert the service, with
 * provenance visible. Both halves.
 *
 * ── Why the wording is in core ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Same rule as `consultant-context-kinds.ts`: what a claim **means** and what
 * to call it is product judgement and lives here so both clients make the same
 * claim; how the chip looks — Lucide and Tailwind on web, a bordered `View` on
 * the phone — is presentation and stays with the platform. A provenance label
 * that drifts between clients means the laptop and the phone say different
 * things about the same car, which is the exact failure the context-kind
 * labels were split out to prevent.
 *
 * Deliberately **not** `CONTEXT_KIND_LABELS`. Those mean "this was put in front
 * of the model", which is a claim about a prompt. These mean "this is where the
 * number came from", which is a claim about a fact. Overloading one set to
 * carry both is how `wishlist` and `service` collapsed into one chip and the
 * app asserted a mod profile for a car that had none.

    A line item extracted from an invoice is evidence: a document said so. An
    onboarding answer is a **recollection** — "I think the last big service was
    around 85,000" — given on a sign-up screen by somebody who mainly wants to
    finish signing up. Both are far better than nothing and both belong in the
    calculation. Only one of them is a record.

    "You told us" rather than "From your notes" because it names the source as a
    person's memory, which is the part a reader needs in order to judge it. This
    is the same reasoning that made `generated-schedule` say "typical" instead
    of "manufacturer-recommended": the weaker word is the true one.

 * The same three claims, for a row that has no room for a sentence.
 *
 * ── 12 Sep · B6, the last open line on the phone's Service tab ─────────────
 *
 * The Due row's meta line is the interval and the basis on one line:
 * *"Every 15,000 mi · Based on what you told us at sign-up"*. At every iPhone
 * width that orphans a word, and the design critic's answer (rounds 34–36)
 * was a mono token — `· SIGN-UP`, `· RECORDS`, `· ESTIMATED` — rather than
 * a second line. The token has to live here, beside the sentence it stands
 * for, or the phone and the web start making different claims about one
 * car, which is the failure this file exists to prevent.
 *
 * ⚠ Each token is the head word of its sentence and nothing more: RECORDS
 * is "from your service records", SIGN-UP is "what you told us at sign-up",
 * ESTIMATED is "estimated from your mileage". `service-provenance.test.ts`
 * holds each token to its sentence, so a token cannot quietly claim more
 * than the sentence does (CLAUDE.md §10). A client that prints the token
 * still owes the reader the sentence — on the phone it is the row's
 * accessibility label, so a screen reader hears the claim in full.
